# Bike-Buyers-Dataset
Excel remains one of the most powerful and user-friendly tools for data analysis. With its simplicity and versatility, it allows users to turn raw data into actionable insights
Using a dataset provided by Quantum Analytics NG , I created this dashboard to uncover various insights across different regions. Key metrics analyzed include:

1. Income by Region 
2. ⁠Average income by Region and Bike Purchased
3. ⁠Bike Purchased by Region & Car Owner
4. ⁠Average income by Gender
5. ⁠Average income by Age Category 
6. ⁠Average income by Marital Status 
7. ⁠Average income by Marital Status & Bike Purchased
8. ⁠Average income by Occupation & Home Owner

In summary, North America has the highest income by region, and they have the highest rate of people who purchased bike. From the dashboard, we can also see the married couples purchased more bikes than the singles. 

This project highlights how Excel can be used to create visually appealing and informative dashboards that support better decision-making.
